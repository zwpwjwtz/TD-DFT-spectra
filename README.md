# TD-DFT method for fitting UV-Visble Spectra

This code is originally written by Chen Hao for reimplementing algorithm mentioned in [the article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theochem.2010.04.038). Modified version provides functions for analysing multiple groups of data in one batch, as well as fitting for parameters in gaussian function.
